### Hello, I am Marcin
I am working as a truck driver but I want to become a Java Developer. My current job does not give me satisfaction however that is not main reason, that I want to leave this profession. I have always been interested in the field of science and technology. I know at work as programmer I could spend definitely more time with these areas.
